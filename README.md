# Chess Game Simulation

## Description
Developed a fully functional chess game simulation using Java, incorporating object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. The project involved creating a modular and extensible system that supports game rules enforcement, player interaction, and dynamic board visualization.

## Key Features

### Game Rules Implementation
- Enforced complete chess rules, including movement logic for all pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King).
- Implemented special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

### Dynamic Game State Management
- Designed a `Board` class to maintain the current state of the game.
- Enabled real-time updates and move validation.

### Player Turn and Interaction
- Integrated turn-based mechanics for two players.
- Provided feedback for invalid moves, check, checkmate, and draw scenarios.

### Modular Architecture
- Used inheritance to create distinct classes for each chess piece.
- Enhanced code readability and reusability.

### Console-based Visualization
- Built a text-based user interface to display the chessboard.
- Supported player move inputs via the console.
